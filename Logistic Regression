Logistic regression is best used to predict binary outcome(1/0,yes or no) given a set of independent variable .Logistic regression is a part of a larger class named  as Generalized	Linear Model .

(checked it)its proved to suit those critirea which was not supposed to be efficent by linear regression

Generalized Linear Mode(glm) equation:
					g(E(y))=α + βx1 + γx2
			g():is the link function
			E():is the expectation of target variables
			α + βx1 + γx2: is the linear(α,β,γ to be predicted)
